	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Here’s an example of an about page. I’ve mostly included it to show you how you can link to other pages. You can keep it or if you don't need an entire page for your about section, you can delete this file.</p>
	<p>Contact me here: <a href="mailto:me@mywebsite.com">me@mywebsite.com</a></p>
	<p>Above is an example of an email link!</p>
	<p>Visit my Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/rifke.world" target='_blank'>here</a></p>
	<p>Above here is a link to a different website. The 'target='_blank' will open the link in a new tab or window so users still have an easy way to go back to this page if they want to.</p>

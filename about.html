	<h1>about me</h1>

	<p class="maintagline" style="margin:2em !important;">
		I am a London & Essex-based creative with a passion for spreading joy, be it through a printed page, through copy that brightens your day, or through direction of an engaging multimedia project; I donâ€™t discriminate!

    <p class="bio">In my practice, experimentation is vital, drawing on my natural resourcefulness and exploring different perspectives to bring new life to ideas. Innovative concepts are my jam!
			I value originality, and no two works of mine are ever the same. I am always looking to better myself and my skills, currently indulging in mixed media, like collage and photography, and I am a typography nerd. Organic and playful design is what I do; a harmony of powerful words and images is the balance I try to find.
			I love to celebrate the inner child through my creative pursuits and bring out innate joy and empathy in all of us.

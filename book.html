<p class="expl">Take a look through my re-creation of The New Art of Making Books by Ulises Carrion! I based the imagery for the book around my experimentation with the book’s form, which is a main theme of the text. Using a scanner to capture my pushing, twisting and pulling of a book, I created an alphabet of letter forms. I split the pages into two sections, rearranging the text that describes ‘old art’, and ‘new art’. </p>

<p class="expl">The new object celebrates the form of the book in both its delicate pages, and its imagery taken from my experimentation. I explored duality and juxtaposition throughout, the stark black and white palette inspired by this.</p>
